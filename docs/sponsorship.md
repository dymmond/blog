## 🔥 Sponsor the author

The author built this framework with all of his heart and dedication and will continue to do it so but that also
requires time and resources and when they are limited, the process still gets there but takes a bit longer.

You can financially help and support the author though [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tarsil)

He can afterwards go for a coffee☕, on him, to say thanks🙏.
